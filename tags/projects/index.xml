      <description>The problem Local development environments are full of tradeoffs. Do you optimize for ease of installation, or &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; environment fidelity? Do you seed a subset of your production data for testing, or do you generate random datasets? Should it each service(persistence, api, batch) in the application be optional when developing new features? If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, these considerations are often a stumbling block on the path to a working prototype.</description>

      <description>awesomefeedmachine.com has been a side project of mine ever since google shutdown their rss service. I&amp;rsquo;ll be documenting my work on this project here. Now of course there are numerous rss readers apps out there, I just want to try rolling my own.
The Problem I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet completed a full rss reader project after years of tinkering. Unless you count my original version which I&amp;rsquo;ve lost the code for.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to start a project that could be considered a real contribution to my community. However, this is somewhat difficult without a lot of free time on your hands. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;m currently in staycation mode between jobs so I decided to hack together a service to address a need in my local area.
The Problem Semi-skilled service workers require training and experience to be effective. Conversely, these jobs are typically lower wage part-time jobs that are looked at as a transitional position.</description>
