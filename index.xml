      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to start a project that could be considered a real contribution to my community. However, this is somewhat difficult without a lot of free time on your hands. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;m currently in staycation mode between jobs so I decided to hack together a service to address a need in my local area.
The Problem Semi-skilled service workers require training and experience to be effective. Conversely, these jobs are typically lower wage part-time jobs that are looked at as a transitional position.</description>
